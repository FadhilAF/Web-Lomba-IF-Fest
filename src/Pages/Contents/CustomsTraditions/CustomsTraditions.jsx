						roof made of straw or reeds. Honai has a small
						door and no windows. Actually, the structure
						was built Honai narrow or small, windowless
						intended to withstand the cold mountains of
						Papua.
						<br/><br />
						Honai consists of two floors of the first
						floor as a bed and a second floor for a place
						to relax, eat, and do crafts. Due to built 2
						floor, Honai has approximately 2.5 meters high.
						In the middle of the house prepared a place for
						a bonfire to warm themselves. Honai house is
						divided into three types, namely for men (called
						Honai), women (called Ebei), and pigsty (called
						Wamai)

						people. Honai house in one building used for a 
						place to rest (sleep), other buildings for dining 
						together, and the third building to the cattle 
						pens. Houses Honai generally divided into two 
						levels. Ground floor and first floor are 
						connected by stairs from bamboo. The men slept 
						on the ground floor in a circle, while the women 
						slept on the floor

						Inside the house Honai or Ebei, look no single 
						household. Honai indeed be a home for people in 
						the township Wamena. But for the beds, they only 
						use dry grass as the base. Alas it will be 
						replaced with new grass taken from the field or 
						garden, if you've seen dirty. Inside Honai also 
						no chairs or tables, they make the floor of the 
						house made of soil as a cushion.
						<br /><br />
						Inside the house Honai also no electric lights. 
						For lighting, they make fire by digging the soil 
						in the bottom floor of the house to be a furnace. 
						Because Honai has no windows and illumination only 
						from the fire, the atmosphere in the house will 
						feel more and more dark when night falls.
						<br /><br />
						In a housing complex occupied by one family and 
						there are several Honai. The number indicates the 
						number of wives Honai there, here found many men 
						of more than one wife in particular tribal chiefs 
						or Ondoafi.

						There once a time, boy named Kweiya. He lives with
						his mom and his step siblings. His step siblings
						didn't like him. So, they plotted a scheme and 
						successfully made Kweiya lost in the middle of
						a forest.
						<br /><br />
						The poor lost Kweiya on forest tries to live. He
						made a simple wooden house and hunt. The leather
						from an animal that he kills is used to make 
						threads. He wanted to make wings from that thread.
						<br /><br />
						His mom not knowing where he is, is on a deep
						sorrow. All her step children lied to her, saying 
						that Kweiya don't want to live with her anymore. 
						Until the youngest step children told her the truth, 
						That the older sibling made Kweiya lost in a forest.
						<br /><br />
						His mom starts to run immediately after hearing the
						truth. She shouts his name countless number of time
						at the forest, but still no answer from him. And then
						his mom sees a bird from the trees. "eek.. eek.." it
						says, once the bird comes in front of her eyes.
						Kweiya's mom surprised that, the bird she is seeing
						right now is Kweiya on a very beautiful bird form 
						trying to give bunch of threads to her hands.
						<br /><br />
						His mom then take the threads, and put it on the
						bottom of her hands. In no time, she transformed
						into a bird too. Then,she flies with Kweiya. Kweiya's
						step siblings look at them knowing they already
						became a very beautiful bird. Kweiya's step siblings
						regret what they did. But its already too late, they
						already became a beautiful bird that now people calls
						Cendrawasih.
