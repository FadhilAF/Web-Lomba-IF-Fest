						This typical Papuan food is the staple food of the lowland and 
						coastal communities of Papua. The tribes that make papeda as 
						their staple food are the Asmat, Mappi, and Mimika tribes. 
						Papeda itself is more popular in the Manokwari indigenous 
						community.
						<br /><br />
						Papeda is a food that is rich in fiber, cholesterol, and enough 
						to meet human nutrition. The main ingredient of papeda comes from 
						sago flour sourced from the sago tree in Papua. Sago is already 
						widely known by the people of eastern Indonesia.
						<br /><br />
						Not only that, but sago is also widely known by the Malay community 
						such as Malaysia and Brunei. This food called papeda is also well 
						known by the Malay community as ‘Linut’. Especially in South 
						Sulawesi, this food is known as ‘Kapurung’.
						<br /><br />
						In addition to sago flour, the ingredients needed to make this dish 
						are water and a little salt to add a salty taste. How to cook and 
						make it is also fairly easy to include all the ingredients at once 
						and cook until thickened.
						<br /><br />
						For companion ingredients to eat papeda, you can combine several 
						side dishes such as various fish dishes, or other dishes. You can 
						combine it with soupy food or stir-fried food which is also 
						suitable to accompany eating papeda.
