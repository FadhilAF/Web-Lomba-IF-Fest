# Static website made for a competition submission at university

Because this static website use React.js, we cant just open this file and see the website right away.
Here's some stuff you need to do:

### 1. Clone This Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/FadhilAF/Web-Lomba-IF-Fest.git
```

You can install it from the official Node.js website [Here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### 3. Go to the folder that just cloned before
Go to the file position where you do the `git clone` command.
If you're still there, the command is:
```
cd Web-Lomba-If-Fest
```

### 4. Install the required packages using npm
npm stands for nodejs package manager, you already got this from
downloading Node.js using the installer.
The command you need to run is:
```
npm install
```
And just wait until the installation is done.

### 5. Run the website on a localhost server
The React.js needs to render the code on this file first, we can
ask React.js to run this file and put it in localhost.
```
npm run dev
```
